Today I am here to announce the creation of Margarina Records (MGR), the new music label founded by the members of Margarina. Expect exceptional tracks, as our stars are inspired only by the best: <b>MC VV, Luckhaos, Liu, etc...</b></p> <p>We currently have two songs in production - one is a cover, and the other is a reimagining of an existing song. Although there are other ideas being developed, this is what we are focusing on the most right now. The main people involved in MGR are: <b>mrnandokk, Murailus, and tenkuma</b>.</p> <p><i>Spoiler: the first song will feature ArthAttack and Murailus on vocals, as the two will finally resolve the rivalry they have with each other.</i></p> <p>--<br>Adrian Victor - <a href=http://adrianvictor.rf.gd>visit my website</a><br> <i>Fantasy is not a crime, find your castle in the sky.</i></p>"
