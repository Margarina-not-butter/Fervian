Fervian is Margarina's website/blog made with HTML, CSS and JS. It has a built in blog system made entirely in vanilla JavaScript that only needs the server to serve the website + post JSON. It uses a simple ``post()`` to retrieve the blog post and there's no indexing of posts on ``index.html`` so this should be done manually.

## Libraries used
 - jQuery
 - 98.css (modifications are made)

## Imported fonts
 - Pixelated MS Sans Serif

## Blog post template
```
{  
    "title": "Example",
    "htmlContent":"<p>This is an example post.</p>"
}
```

## Why this exists?
I love making lightwheight solutions for stuff that do not need that much engieneering. Plus that's perfect for extremely trimmed down hosting solutions like [NeoCities](https://neocities.org) and [Infinityfree](https://infinityfree.com)/their users that are sometimes reluctant in using complex coding in their website.
